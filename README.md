# Guess-A-Word
A windows form hangman game. Yes, I drew the pictures myself.


This is a Windows Form hang man game that I made. The words that are guessed are stored
in the string array theWords which is found in Main Form.cs.

In the future, I will make is so that the words that are guessed are read from a text file,
so it is easy to change them.
